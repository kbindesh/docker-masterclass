## What are `Docker Images`?

- A **Docker image** is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform
- It provides a convenient way to package up applications and preconfigured server environments, which you can use for your own private use or share publicly with other Docker users
- A Docker image is made up of a collection of files that bundle together all the essentials, such as:
  - Installations
  - Application code
  - Dependencies – required to configure a fully operational container environment.

### The `Layered Filesystem`

- Container images are templates from which containers are created.
- These images are not made up of just one monolithic block but are composed of many layers.
- The first layer in the image is also called the **base layer**.
- Each layer contains some files and folders.
- Each layer only contains the changes to the filesystem concerning the underlying layers.
- The **layers of a container image are all immutable**. Hence, once generated, the layer cannot ever be changed.

## What is `Docker Build Context`?

1.  Local Context
2.  Remote Context

## Different ways of `creating Docker Images`

1. **Creating Image `interactively`**

2. **Creating Image using `Dockerfile`**

3. **Creating Image by `importing it into the system from a tarball`**
