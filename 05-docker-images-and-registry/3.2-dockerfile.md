# Building Container Images using `Dockerfile`

## Dockerfile instructions

### `FROM` instruction

### `RUN` instruction

- RUN allows us to execute any valid Linux command in the image during the build process.

### `WORKDIR` instruction

### `COPY` instruction

### `ADD` instruction

### `EXPOSE` instruction

- EXPOSE instruction allows you to declare all ports that the application is listening on and that need to be accessible from outside of the container.

```
EXPOSE 5000

EXPOSE 15672/tcp
```

### `CMD` instruction

### `ENTRYPOINT` instruction

### `ENV` instruction

- ENV instruction allows us to define environment variables the application uses and provide sensible defaults.

```
ENV LOG_PATH=/var/lib/app.log
ENV COUNT=1245
```

### `VOLUME` instruction

## Dockerfile - Best Practices

- We should always try to minimize the time it takes to initialize the application running inside the container by minimizing the setup and configuration, as well as the time needed to terminate or clean up the application.

- We should order the individual commands in the Dockerfile so that we leverage caching as much as possible so that we can reduce the build times. Building a layer of an image can take a considerable amount of time sometimes many seconds, or even minutes.
