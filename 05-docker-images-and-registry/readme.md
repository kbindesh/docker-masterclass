## `Assignment-01`: Create a Docker Image from a Container after customizing it (aka _Interactive Image Creation_)

### Step-1.1: Create a Container

### Step-1.2: Customize it as per your requirements (e.g. install packages)

### Step-1.3: Exit from the Container

### Step-1.4: Display what has been changed in our container with respect to the base image

### Step-1.5: Create a new Image from the container by keeping our modifications

### Step-1.6: List Docker Images (on dockerhost)

### Step-1.7: Check history of a Docker Image

## `Assignment-02`: Building an Image using `Dockerfile`

### Step-2.1: Pull the application source code

### Step-2.2: Create a Dockerfile

### Step-2.3: Create a new Docker Image using Dockerfile

### Step-2.3: List all the Images

## `Assignment-03`: Push the Docker image to Registry (DockerHub)

### Step-3.1: Create a DockerHub Account

### Step-3.2: Rename/Tag Docker Image as per registry (DockerHub) naming convention

### Step-3.3: Push the Image to DockerHub

### Step-3.4: Verify the image on registry

## `Assignment-04`: Push the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

## `Assignment-05`: Push the Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

## `Assignment-06`: Demonstrate `multi-stage builds`
